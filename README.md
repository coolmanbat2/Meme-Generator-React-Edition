# Meme Generator (React Native Version)

Functions the same as the previous Meme generator application, but with a couple of differences:
1) No pre-selection of meme images.
2) Ability to add your own or friend images
3) Can the memes created by you.

# Requirements

Note: These are the requirements for building the application on React Native CLI Quickstart for iOS.

- React Native 0.63
- Node
- Watchman
- Latest version of XCode.
- CocoaPods
- Some text editor for coding (I recommend VSCode)
- yarn

## Installation

1) Clone this repository
2) Open the repository on your text editor.
3) Installation Complete :)

## Running the application on iOS.

1) Open up terminal or command prompt and redirect it to the folder in which you cloned the repo.
2) Type in: 
```bash
yarn install 
```
_This will install all the necessary dependencies into your computer, make sure you have enough space for it!_
2) Then type in:
```bash
npx react-native run-ios
```
_This command will allow you to run the app on a simulated iOS iPhone._

# What if I want to run this on my own iPhone?

You will need to refer to the React Native docs <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device">here</a>
